tha site for the hard hat. the code isnt here, this is just the site the hard hat displays.

how it works is that you put a phrase or a link to an image [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScbx5pRyAPWwDtTE5MaOprbkHUPFaV1d3CjqE495JrQiDsMqQ/viewform) and then that prhase/image is displayed on the hardhats 
screen. its pretty cool and everyone likes it and its not heavy at all

these are all REAL THINGS that REAL PEOPLE put in the google form that i had to wear on my head.
